"""backtalk — talk to your Claude Code agent out loud.

Flow: hold the key and speak -> local transcription -> your agent's warm
Claude session streams the reply -> sentences go to the mouth the moment
they complete (~1-2s to first audio on warm turns). The greeting plays
over a hidden warmup query so the first real turn is already hot.

Typing in this terminal is a first-class turn too: same conversation,
spoken reply, and typing while it talks interrupts it.

THE VOICE CONSOLE: exact phrases, spoken (or typed) alone, control the
session itself so you never go back to the keyboard: "clear the
session" / "compact the session" / "switch to the deep model" / "back
to the fast model" / "set effort to low" (or medium, high, max) /
"usage report" / "pause" and "resume" (stand by without hanging up;
Fn+Control toggles) / "switch to haiku" / "switch to sonnet" /
"switch to the deep model" (Fn+Option cycles tiers) /
"go hands free" and "push to talk mode" (the MIC) /
"stop asking for permission" and "start asking again" (permissions,
called auto-approve, a different axis than the microphone on purpose).
And with permission_mode "ask" (the default), gated tool calls ASK OUT
LOUD and your spoken yes or no decides them; any other answer is
passed back to the agent as the reason.

Flags:
  --open-mic   start in hands-free listening for this session (the
               config key mic_mode makes it the standing default, and
               the voice can switch live either way: "go hands free" /
               "push to talk mode"). Know the tradeoff: room audio (a
               video, music, another voice assistant) can trigger
               replies to speech never meant for the agent. The talk
               key keeps working: it interrupts, and holding it always
               gets you heard.
  --barge-in   with --open-mic: keep listening WHILE speaking.
               HEADPHONES REQUIRED — with open speakers the mic hears
               the reply and the agent interrupts itself.
  --model X    override the model for this session (full id).

Say "goodbye <name>" / "end voice mode" to hang up. Ctrl-C works.
