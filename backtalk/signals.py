"""The signal bus — tiny files any other program can watch.

The voice line leaves notes; faces read the notes. That one dumb trick
is the whole integration surface:

  .voice_state        idle | listening | thinking | speaking | paused
  .voice_waveform     JSON {ts, samples: [64 floats]} while audio plays
  .voice_loading_pid  exists while the thinking sound is playing
  .voice_rate_limits  JSON {window: {utilization, resets_at}} — only
                      written when show_usage is on

Written to signals_dir (default: the repo root). Visualizers built on
this contract just work.

THE BAREHANDS SEAM: set barehands_state_dir in backtalk.json to a
barehands checkout's state/ folder and the same signals are mirrored in
its format (state/state as a bare word, state/wave.json normalized
0..1) — the on-screen ring becomes your agent's face with zero glue.

Every write is wrapped: the bus must never crash the voice line.
