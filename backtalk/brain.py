"""The warm brain — a persistent Claude session via the Agent SDK,
streaming.

One ClaudeSDKClient lives for the whole voice session: no per-turn
process spawn, no per-turn context reload. Partial-message streaming
means sentences are yielded the moment they're complete, so the mouth
starts speaking while the rest of the thought is still forming.

The session's cwd is YOUR agent's folder (agent_dir in backtalk.json) —
whatever CLAUDE.md lives there defines who is speaking. backtalk adds
only the spoken-delivery discipline (config.DISCIPLINE): the medium,
never the character.
